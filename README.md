## Overview
DOF Synthesis 2026 is a cutting-edge hackathon project that leverages A2A, MCP, x402, and OASF protocols to create a decentralized, multi-chain platform. Our project utilizes the Base Mainnet, Status Network, and Arbitrum chains, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture.

## Architecture
The following diagram illustrates our system's architecture:

```

## Statistics
| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Autonomous Cycles Completed | 142 |
| Attestations On-Chain | 33+ |
| Auto-Generated Features | 5 |
| Days Until Deadline | 5 |

"""
TestGenerator + BenchmarkRunner — Automated adversarial test generation
and FDR/FPR measurement for DOF governance layers.

Generates deterministic (seeded) test datasets across 4 categories:
  - Hallucination detection (date/number/entity/source fabrication)
  - Code safety (eval/import/secrets/clean)
  - Governance compliance (language/hallucination/length violations)
  - Consistency (intra-output contradictions)

BenchmarkRunner measures: FDR, FPR, Precision, Recall, F1 per category.

Zero LLM tokens — all tests run locally in seconds.
